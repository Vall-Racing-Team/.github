# About us
***Vall Racing Team*** is an association of students from the *University of Valladolid*, dedicated to consolidate and expand the engineering knowledge of its members by developing a single-seater to compete in *Formula Student*.

Our mission is to create an academy of engineers able to face and solve problems quickly and to be flexible in the face of changes. We achieve all this thanks to the knowledge that we acquire throughout the degree, and that we can apply to real situations, working as a team and acquiring an expertise that otherwise we could not.

The goal is to develop a formula car to compete in FSS and other European FS competitions, improving year after year the formula and implementing technologies, processes and materials at the forefront.
